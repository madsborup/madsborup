Hello, my name is Mads. I’m a front-end developer-in-progress with a BSc in Interaction Design from Aalborg University.

In my studies I’ve had courses in OOP, discrete mathematics and software engineering and practical experience with user-centered design and methodologies like sketching, prototyping and user research. 

I like learning new things and discovering new ways to create. Right now I’m working on learning React, and how to use TypeScript and libraries like styled-components to create reuseable components for systems.

I also enjoy working with electronics (like Arduino) and p5.js.
