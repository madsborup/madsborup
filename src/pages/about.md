## Hi, my name is Mads.
<Image src={profile} maxWidth="190px" align='right' />

I’m a front-end developer-in-progress with a BSc in Interaction Design from Aalborg University.

I like learning new things and discovering new ways to create. Currently I'm working on improving my React and TypeScript skills.

I’ve had courses in OOP, discrete mathematics and software engineering and practical experience with user-centered design and methods like sketching, prototyping (physical and digital) and user research.
